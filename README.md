# cse-258-Recommender-systems
Homework for CSE 258 at UCSD.
The website of this course is http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/fa17/cse258-a/.
The course is given by Prof. Julian McAuley.
I personly think it's a very good course especially for starter like me. It offers me with basic understanding on machine models and many practical data processing skills with Python.
